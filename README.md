## AI Assistant

StudentFlow includes a floating AI chat widget powered by **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**.

**How it works:**
- Each role (student / teacher / admin) gets a custom system prompt
- If OpenAI API key is missing or quota is exceeded, smart keyword-based fallback replies are shown automatically
- No error messages are ever shown to the user — the experience stays clean

**Fallback keyword detection:**

| Keyword | Response |
|---|---|
| hello / hi | Hello! How can I help you today? |
| math | Math is the study of numbers, shapes, and patterns... |
| science | Science helps us understand the world around us... |
| attendance | You can check your attendance in the dashboard... |
| fees | You can check your fees status in the Fees section... |
| assignment | You can view your assignments in the Assignments section... |
| result / marks | Check the Results page for your subject-wise marks... |
| timetable | Your class timetable is available in the Timetable section... |
| notice / announcement | Check the Notifications section for latest notices... |
| event | View and register for upcoming events in the Events section... |
| default | I'm here to help! Please ask your question in detail. |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- npm v9+

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd studentflow
```

### 2. Setup Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values (see below).

Run database migrations:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Seed the database with sample data:
```bash
npm run seed
```

Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Backend runs on: `http://localhost:4000`

### 3. Setup Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on: `http://localhost:5173`

---

## Environment Variables

Create `backend/.env` with the following:

```env
# Server
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=development

# JWT
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here

# OpenAI (optional — smart fallbacks work without it)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

> If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set or is invalid, the AI assistant automatically uses smart keyword-based fallback responses. No setup required for basic usage.
